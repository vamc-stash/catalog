## Installations
`npm i types @types/chrome`

## Setup
I did not deploy the code in [chrome webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/). So, you need to set this up from your local system. <br>
1. Clone this [repo](https://github.com/vamc-stash/catalog.git). <br>
2. Go to Chrome Extensions [page](https://chrome://extensions/) and turn on `Developer Mode` key.<br>
3. Press the `Load unpacked` button and navigate to [src](https://github.com/vamc-stash/catalog/tree/master/src) folder which contains [manifest](https://github.com/vamc-stash/catalog/blob/master/src/manifest.json) file inside the downloaded repo.
